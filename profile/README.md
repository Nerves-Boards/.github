# Nerves Boards

This Org is dedicated to the design and manufacture of cutting-edge, ready-to-mass-produce circuit boards, spec'd by and for the [Nerves community](https://nerves-project.org/community/).

Our goal is to eliminate the need to migrate from a proto-board (such as a [raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) or [Beaglebone](https://beagleboard.org/bone)) to custom hardware when bringing a new product to market.  The high cost of custom design and low-volume manufacturing, typically encountered when bringing a new product to market, represents a massive barrier to entry for new ideas and technologies.

With their easy to build and deploy, open source production embedded system, the [Nerves Project community](https://nerves-project.org/) has paved the way for the development of massively flexible, customizable, and secure open source hardware:
  - By **manufacturing** low-cost, high performance boards for the Nerves community we hope to promote development on real-world hardware that can be taken directly to mass-manufacturing.  
  - By **developing** open source hardware, we can remove the burden of intellectual property so that community and/or industry members can order in bulk together for the steepest possible volume discount.
  - By **creating** hardware with a variety of common sensors and components for the open source community, we hope to minimise time-to-market for Nerves-based products by promoting the development of open-source libraries.  
  - By **exploring** the best component, vendor, and manufacturer selection we can help community members avoid price gouging, while also minimizing certification costs and the amount of effort required to ensure environmental regulation compliance. 
  - By **iterating** together along with our combined experience, we can do our best to help people avoid common pitfalls of PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) design for manufacturing.
